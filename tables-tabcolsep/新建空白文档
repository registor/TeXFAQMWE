How do I change column or row separation in LaTeX tables?
One option is to use the commands \setlength and \arraystretch to change the horizontal spacing (column separation) and the vertical spacing (row separation) respectively.

Example settings:

\setlength{\tabcolsep}{20pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
